# Cron

Void Linux comes without a default cron daemon, you can choose one of multiple cron implementations, by installing the package and enabling the system service.

Available choices include `cronie`, `dcron`, `fcron` and more.

As alternative to the standard cron implementations you can use something like [snooze](https://github.com/chneukirchen/snooze) or `runwhen` which go hand in hand with service supervision.
