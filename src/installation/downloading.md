# Downloading Void Linux

## Live Images

Live images can be downloaded from [https://repo.voidlinux.org/live/](https://repo.voidlinux.eu/live/).

## Static XBPS binaries

Static xbps images can be downloaded from [https://repo.voidlinux.eu/static/](https://repo.voidlinux.eu/static/).

```
$ wget https://repo.voidlinux.eu/static/xbps-static-latest.$(uname -m)-musl.tar.xz
```

After [verifying the integrity](#verifying-integrity) you can extract and use the binaries.

```
$ tar xfv xbps-static-latest.$(uname -m)-musl.tar.xz
$ ./usr/bin/xbps-install -h
```

### Verifying integrity

The image release directories contain a `sha256sums.txt` and a
`sha256sums.txt.asc` file to verify the integrity of the downloaded images.

```
$ wget http://repo.voidlinux.eu/live/current/sha256sums.txt{,.asc}
```

You can now verify the integrity of downloaded file using [sha256sum(1)](https://man.voidlinux.eu/sha256sum.1).

```
$ sha256sum -c --ignore-missing sha256sums.txt
void-live-x86_64-musl-20170220.iso: OK
```

This just makes sure that the file was not corrupted while downloading.

To verify that the downloaded files are the ones that the Void Linux maintainers published and signed you can use pgp.

The file is signed with Juan RPâ€™s GPG key:
* Signer: `Juan RP <xtraeme@voidlinux.eu>`
* KeyID: `482F9368`
* Fingerprint: `F469 EAEF 52F5 9627 75B8  20CD AF19 F6CB 482F 9368`

You can use [gpg(1)](https://man.voidlinux.eu/gpg.1) to receive the key from a keyserver using the following command or download it from [https://repo.voidlinux.eu/live/xtraeme.asc](https://repo.voidlinux.eu/live/xtraeme.asc).

```
$ gpg --recv-keys 482F9368
gpg: key AF19F6CB482F9368: public key "Juan RP <xtraeme@voidlinux.eu>" imported

You can now verify the signature of the `sha256sums.txt` file with [gpg(1)](https://man.voidlinux.eu/gpg.1).

```
$ gpg --verify sha256sums.txt.asc
gpg: assuming signed data in 'sha256sums.txt'
